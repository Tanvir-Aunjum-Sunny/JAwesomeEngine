JAwesomeEngine
==============

JAwesomeEngine is a java-based 3D engine using OpenGL, OpenAL, GLFW (via [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/)) and [JInput](https://java.net/projects/jinput). The goal is to create a stable and easy-to-use game engine. Right now JAwesomeEngine is still under development but you can already use the working parts.  
The engine is split up into three parts:
* *JAwesomeEngine*: the core game engine handling rendering, inputs, etc.
* *JAwesomeBase*: the small base package with everything needed by the Game- and Physics-engine like e.g. vector and matrix calculation classes
* *JAwesomePhysics*: a physics engine that can detect and resolve collisions
